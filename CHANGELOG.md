## v1.1.0 (March 25, 2013)
- **Added view managemet**. Allow the final user to save views of the current filters, sortings... applied on the table.
- Removed [JSON.NET v4.5.11](http://json.codeplex.com/) dependency (Use now standard built in .NET JavaScriptSerializer which is slower in performance but as JSON is not used a lot the final user won't notice the difference on the speed).
- Clear session data inside the dll.
- Bug fixes.
